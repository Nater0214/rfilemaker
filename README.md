rfilemaker
==========

A utility to make garbage!


Background
----------

This is the third installation in the file maker series! Here they are in order.
1. [File-Maker](https://github.com/Nater0214/File-Maker) written in AHK
2. File-Maker-2 (not on GitHub) written in Java
3. [rfilemaker](https://github.com/Nater0214/rfilemaker) written in Rust

This is my first Rust project! I think it went well.

Whenever I am learning a new language, this is a project I start with as I have to learn many of the language's concepts to finish it. I discovered the Tokio library for epic async stuff, which I use to make files in parallel. I learned structs and implementations to make the `job::Job`. This was a good project for learning Rust and I hope to continue to make more epic ones.


Bugs/Optimizations
------------------

Since this is my first Rust project, I'm sure it has bugs and/or could be much more optimized. If you have any ideas you care to share then make an issue or, better yet, make a pull request with your changes. I'll look at what you have to say.
